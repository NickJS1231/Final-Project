# Portfolio Utility: A Comparative Analysis
# The Research
This project aims to assess the utility of a given portfolio theme (i.e., sustainability, low beta, Technology, etc.) when compared to a larger sample of securities (the S&P 500). Essentially, *how much utility do you sacrifice by restricting your portfolio to a given theme of securitues?* At large scale (the big question), research in this area aims to validate the marginal utility of increased diversification, by showing compromises in utility in a given subset of the larger sample. More directly, this research aims to show which themes of portfolios have which effects relative to the larger sample.

To visualize this, the project will create a dashboard that graphs the efficient frontier of a large sample (the S&P 500). Additionally, upon selection, the dashboard will then graph the efficient frontier of subsample of the data based on a given portfolio theme. The themes will include:
- Sustainability focused firms
- High Growth
- Low Beta
- Technology
- etc

The Analysis will then assess the following:
- Which firms are included in the subset vs the benchmark?
- What is the marginal utility of the subset (assessed through the utility equation)
- Given different risk aversion levels (different points on the capital allocation line) how much more/less efficient does the subset become?
